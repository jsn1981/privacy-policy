  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 9, 2025</p>

  <p>This privacy policy outlines how the <strong>Pre-Caste Census Sample App</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “the app”) collects, uses, and protects your personal information. Our application is used for pre-caste census data collection and includes a dedicated accessibility module for visually impaired users that utilizes a Braille keyboard, text-to-speech feedback, and accessible UI features.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>1.1 Location Information</h3>
  <p>The app collects your device’s precise location <strong>only when you are using the app</strong> to tag census entries with accurate geographic data. Location is not collected in the background or when the app is closed.</p>

  <h3>1.2 Contact Information (Optional)</h3>
  <p>The app may request access to your contacts only when you choose to associate a contact manually with a data entry (e.g., to verify census details). No background contact scanning is performed.</p>

  <h3>1.3 Call Log Access (Optional)</h3>
  <p>Call logs may be accessed for government-authorized field agents who verify contact records during census sample acquisition. This is an optional feature and not required for regular users.</p>

  <h3>1.4 Accessibility Services</h3>
  <p>We use the <strong>Android AccessibilityService API</strong> to assist visually impaired users. This service reads out text input and user interface components aloud, and supports Braille input. <strong>We do not log or transmit any content viewed or interacted with via the accessibility service.</strong></p>

  <h3>1.5 Notification Access</h3>
  <p>Notification access is used to provide <strong>voice-based alerts and reminders</strong> to visually impaired users about pending census tasks. No personal notifications or app content from other apps is accessed or stored.</p>

  <h3>1.6 Battery Optimization Exemption</h3>
  <p>We may request that users manually exempt the app from battery optimization to ensure uninterrupted use of background accessibility services. This is especially important for users relying on the voice and Braille input features.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To collect and submit census sample data securely</li>
    <li>To assist visually impaired users with real-time audio feedback</li>
    <li>To provide voice alerts and reminders about incomplete tasks</li>
    <li>To enhance the usability and accuracy of the app in the field</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing and Retention</h2>
  <p>We <strong>do not share</strong> your personal data with any third parties. All collected data is securely transmitted to authorized government servers (where applicable) and stored per regulatory guidelines.</p>
  <p>User data, including location, contact, or call data, is retained only for the time required to complete the assigned census task and is not stored on the device permanently.</p>

  <h2>4. User Controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All permissions are requested explicitly at runtime with clear explanations.</li>
    <li>Users can disable any permission at any time through their device settings.</li>
    <li>Users can continue using the app in a limited capacity without granting optional permissions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>This app is intended for use by government-authorized agents and adult users only. It is not directed to children under the age of 13.</p>

  <h2>6. Security Measures</h2>
  <p>We implement industry-standard security practices including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Encryption of sensitive data during transmission</li>
    <li>Permission-scoped access controls</li>
    <li>No background data collection without consent</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will always be accessible on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
